## Introduction 

[Kathara](https://www.kathara.org) is a network emulation system based on Docker where each device is emulated by an unique container which is interconnected by virtual L2 LANs, and each container can run a Docker image. Kathara is helpful to develop new network protocols within a testing network sandbox environment. It is a NetKit implementation.
